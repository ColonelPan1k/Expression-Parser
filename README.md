# Expression Parser

This is the beginning of a project I've wanted to do for awhile now.  I've been interested in how computers can make sense of a programming language and making
a basic expression parser like this seems to be the best project to play around with how it works.  
All of the code will be written by me, including any extra libraries. I'll be going off of information from LaFore's Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (and moving
it over to C) for the expression evaluation part.
