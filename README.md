# Expression Parser

This is the beginning of a project I've wanted to do for awhile now.  I've been interested in how computers can make sense of a programming language and making
a basic expression parser like this seems to be the best project to play around with how it works.  
Most of the information will be taken and ported from the section on expression evaluation in Lafore's Data strucutres and algorithms book.  I don't think that 
implementation uses any kind of token system, so I'm hoping to add that in the future.  This may also become a basic scheme interpreter someday, who knows.

I'm sure this code will be a complete mess for awhile while I try to figure out how this all fits together but once I've got something working I'll go back, cut and
rework some parts of it to make it cleaner.
