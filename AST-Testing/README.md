# AST

Since the original project didn't have any real tokenizer or a way to create an AST,
I made this section of my repo to play around with adding those features.

This is mostly just a sandbox for testing different methods of proper tokenizing and
some ways of creating an AST.  Eventually these will be integrated into the original
program, but it might be a ways off.
